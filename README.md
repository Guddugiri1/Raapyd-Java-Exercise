<h5>1. Create Java class named Students, which have data members like rollno, name, mobile. Overload constructors to get the data and overload methods to display the data.</h5><br>
<h5>2. Create Java class named Programmer which have data members like pcode, pname, skills. Define one constructor to get the data and Define another constructor to copy details of programmer and Using Method overloading display the content of programmer. One method simply prints the content of programmer and second method prints the details of the programmer based on pcode..</h5><br>
<h5>3. Create an abstract class named Vehicle and define the child class Car, Rikshaw & Bus. Override the method noofWheel() in all child class and implement the same. Create another Java class named TestVehicle and using the reference of Vehicle access noofwheel function of all Vehicle.</h5><br>
<h5>4. Write a Java program which shows constructor chaining using both the ways i.e. super() and this().</h5><br>
<h5>5. Write a Java class named Employee with attributes empno, ename and salary. Attributes must be private and it must be set using constructor and get using methods only.Implements all the class members with constructor overloading, method overloading and define the copy constructor.</h5><br>
<h5>6. Create a Java class named RBI and define the child class AXIS, SBI & HDFC. Override the method getRateOfInterest() in all child class and implement the same. Rate of interest is in floating point. Create another Java class named TestBank and using the reference of RBI access getRateOfInterest() function of all bank.</h5><br>
<h5>7. Modify the program6 and now make RBI class as an abstract class and getRateOfInterest() as an abstract method and implement the same.</h5><br>
<h5>8. Create a Java class named Animal and define the child class Lion, Cat & Dog. Override the method void sound() in all child class and implement the same. Create another Java class named TestAnimal and using the reference of Animal access sound() function of all Animal.</h5><br>
<h5>9. Modify the program8 and now make Animal class as an abstract class and sound() method as an abstract method and implement the same.</h5><br>
<h5>10. Write a Java Program with Class Name - MEDICINE and instance variable MCODE, MNAME, MANUFACTURER and make all variables as private. It must be set using constructor and get using methods only.Implements all the class members with constructor overloading, method overloading and define the copy constructor.</h5><br>
